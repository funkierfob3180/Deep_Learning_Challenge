### Background:

The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, you have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:

EIN and NAME—Identification columns
APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
USE_CASE—Use case for funding
ORGANIZATION—Organization type
STATUS—Active status
INCOME_AMT—Income classification
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application
ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

The instructions below are now updated to use Google Colab for this assignment instead of Jupyter Notebook. If you have already started this assignment using a Jupyter Notebook then you can continue to use Jupyter instead of Google Colab.

 1. Create a new repository for this project called deep-learning-challenge. Do not add this Challenge to an existing repository.

 2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

 3. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Deep Learning Challenge.

  4.Push the above changes to GitHub.
